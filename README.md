# KITT
This is a messy experiment into using a more functional approach to performing Deep RL experiments.

# TODO
- Write overview of how this framework is used
- Go through and clean up tech debt added during the final experiments run for my PhD thesis
- Test more
- Need to port over implementations of DQN, TRPO etc.
